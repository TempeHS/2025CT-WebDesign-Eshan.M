    <p>Cat (Felis catus), also called house cat or domestic cat, is a member of the family Felidae in the order
        Carnivora. It
        is also the smallest member of that family, which includes lions, tigers, and pumas.Cats love the taste of milk
        because
        it is high in fat. They will often choose to drink it even if it results in an upset
        stomach. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no
        matter
        how much they like it.</p>

        or
        reside in a neighborhood as a stray or feral cat</P>
