</body>Cat (Felis catus), also called house cat or domestic cat, is a member of the family Felidae in the order
Carnivora. It
is also the smallest member of that family, which includes lions, tigers, and pumas.Cats love the taste of milk because
it is high in fat. They will often choose to drink it even if it results in an upset
stomach. If your cat is fed a high quality, balanced diet they do not need the extra fat from drinking milk, no matter
how much they like it.
<heading>Domestic cats</heading>
<P>A domestic cat by the sheer definition of the word is supposed to be a cat the resides in a domicileâ€”however, not all
    domestic cats are house cats. Domestic cats can be a purebred, mixed breed, live in a house or farm with humans, or
    reside in a neighborhood as a stray or feral cat</P>
